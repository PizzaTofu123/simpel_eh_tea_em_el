          <p>One of the best indicators to seeing how well a country performs in general is to look at its Life expectancy which represents
            the average years or lifespan a person will have be expected to have if they were to live in the country. It can also be used to
            represent the quality of healthcare and the level of sanitation of the country.
          </p>
          <p>From the presented map of the countries and their corresponding life expectancy throughout the years, it is clear that the life 
            expectancy have been <b>increasing</b> for all the countries throughout decades of development. This can be caused by the economic improvement
            of the country itself or just by the improvement of life qualities of the entire world. <b>Singapore</b> has the highest Life expectancy of 
            <b>83.44 years</b> while <b>Myanmar</b> has the lowest Life expectancy of <b>65.672 years</b> in the most recent year that the data has captured of year 
            <b>2021</b>.

          <p>Overall the population density of most of the Southeast Asian countries have been increasing steadily with a population density level higher than the World average,
            meaning that the Southeast Asian countries are more packed and dense than other countries in the world. Although most of the countries have pretty similar population 
            density growth rate, Singapore has always had the highest population density and also is the fastest growing when compared to all the countries, while other countries 
            number in the hundreds, Singapore is already in the thousands but has seen a plateau in growth in recent years.
