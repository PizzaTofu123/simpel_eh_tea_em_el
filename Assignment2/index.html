          <p>One of the best indicators to seeing how well a country performs in general is to look at its Life expectancy which represents
            the average years or lifespan a person will have be expected to have if they were to live in the country. It can also be used to
            represent the quality of healthcare and the level of sanitation of the country.
          </p>
          <p>From the presented map of the countries and their corresponding life expectancy throughout the years, it is clear that the life 
            expectancy have been <b>increasing</b> for all the countries throughout decades of development. This can be caused by the economic improvement
            of the country itself or just by the improvement of life qualities of the entire world. <b>Singapore</b> has the highest Life expectancy of 
            <b>83.44 years</b> while <b>Myanmar</b> has the lowest Life expectancy of <b>65.672 years</b> in the most recent year that the data has captured of year

            have a <b>birth rate</b> of around <b>more than 40</b>, but that number has now decreased until <b>10+ birth per 1000 people</b> for most of the countries.

          <p>For this section, we will be looking at the <b>HCI (Human Capital Index), Control of corruption Index and Governement effectiveness Index</b> of SEA countries. The <b>HCI</b>
            measures the amount of human capital a child born today can expect to acquire by age 18. <b>Control of Corruption</b> captures perceptions of the extent to 
            which public power is exercised for private gain, and <b>Government Effectiveness</b> captures perceptions of the quality of public services, the quality of the civil
            service and the degree of its independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government
          </p>
          <p>
            From the visualization of the data, there is a regression line that uses the data of all the countries in the world to show the trend of the Control of corruption on Government 
            effectiveness, there is a <b>linear correlation</b> between both the indexes, the higher one of them gets, the higher the other is. That is also <b>true for SEA countries</b>
            where the <b>higher the country is placed in the Government effectiveness index</b>, the <b>better they perform in Control of corruption</b>. It is also evident that <b>the better the country 
            perform in both indexes</b>, the <b>size of the marks</b> also tend to be <b>larger</b> suggesting that there is also <b>a correlation between the two indexes from the axis with HCI</b>.

            Out of the SEA countries, the <b>country with the highest HCI, Control of corruption Index, and Governement effectiveness Index</b> is <b>Singapore</b>
